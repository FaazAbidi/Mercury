The objective of this project is to create an API that can collect the most relevant data from any webpage. This will be an extension of Open Graph tags. We want to enrich the data and hit other options to that.

How can we do that?
Open Graph protocol is a good way of getting basic information for collecting data, but it is limited to the webpages following the Open Graph Protocol. For the sites, that are following this protocol, we don't need just the basic information given in the meta tags. We want to enrich that data with more info. 

We need your help to do this.
